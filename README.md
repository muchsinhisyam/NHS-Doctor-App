# NHS - Doctor App

An internship project by PT Inovasi Telematics Nusantara in collaboration with the Royal European Internship Council London and National Health Services (NHS) UK, England. I tasked as Software Developer / Mobile App Developer where we allow to design, develop, and deliver mobile apps using Flutter framework for NHS care home. Specifically, I developed an doctor side of NHS care home app.
